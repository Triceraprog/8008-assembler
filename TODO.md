- Use the first pass parsing in the second pass.
  - Extract the behaviors
    - Add Instruction with first_pass/second_pass methods
    - Second pass fills the output buffer
    - What about making the listing a separate pass?
    - What about missing args for EQU/ORG/DATA/CPU/... ?
- Option to output an expended, simple assembly code with a syntax for another assembler, especially as8
- Macro system
- Pseudo instructions
- Micral N specific instructions
- New syntax support alongside old syntax
- Check name of executable and if as8, enters a compatible mode if needed
- If the accumulator results in a negative number, various weird things happen, because it's passed as int (wrong hex, wrong lst)
