- Extract the LST generation.
- Change error/exit to exception (will avoid passing some contexts as current_line sometimes)
- Option to output an expended, simple assembly code with a syntax for another assembler, especially as8
- Macro system
- Pseudo instructions
- Micral N specific instructions
- New syntax support alongside old syntax
- Check name of executable and if as8, enters a compatible mode if needed
- Better syntax matching for comments and quoted strings.
- If the accumulator results in a negative number, various weird things happen, because it's passed as int (wrong hex, wrong lst)
