- Create a class around file_reader that handles the filenames to avoid duplication
- Macro system
- Pseudo instructions (specify syntax mode)
- The responsibility of the short format should probably be in Listing
- The listing can be reconstructed without keeping the initial line.
- Option to output an expended, simple assembly code with a syntax for another assembler, especially as8
- Check name of executable and if as8, enters a compatible mode if needed
- If the accumulator results in a negative number, various weird things happen, because it's passed as int (wrong hex, wrong lst)
- Support for priorities in expressions (with optional compatibilities with as8)
- Change the hardcoded path in functional tests to a parameter and generate the call to tests from CMake
