- Support multiple files on command line and .include
  - Define an input stream that can read over several files and inject included files
  - The stream should also give information on the current line of the current file
- Macro system
- Pseudo instructions (specify syntax mode)
- The responsibility of the short format should probably be in Listing
- The listing can be reconstructed without keeping the initial line.
- Option to output an expended, simple assembly code with a syntax for another assembler, especially as8
- Check name of executable and if as8, enters a compatible mode if needed
- If the accumulator results in a negative number, various weird things happen, because it's passed as int (wrong hex, wrong lst)
- Support for priorities in expressions
