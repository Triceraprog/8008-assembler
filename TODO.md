- Add the possibility to output the binary file with only a specified span
- Macro system
  - In the listing, display the replaced tokens in the Macro
- Simplify file declaration in functional tests (based on a naming scheme)
- The responsibility of the short format should probably be in Listing
- Make a pass in the readability to the -debug option
- The listing can be reconstructed without keeping the initial line. Can it?
- Option to output an expended, simple assembly code with a syntax for another assembler, especially as8
- If the accumulator results in a negative number, various weird things happen, because it's passed as int (wrong hex,
  wrong lst)
- Change the hardcoded path in functional tests to a parameter and generate the call to tests from CMake
- If the push/pop contexts have performance problems with copying the options, copy on write could be used.
- Is there a bug when chaining two .ifs ?
